    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",

    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "The framework should be same as most of the CNN, where convolutional layers to reduce/extract the features and fully connected layers to do the deduction. And the input for fc layers should not be too large, so here I reduced the number of features to 4096 (1/40 of the origin).\n",

    "\n",
    "The model contains l2 regularization in order to reduce overfitting (model.py \"Network Architecture\" part). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets, but while training, loss of validation was getting the lowest on the epoch of the third, and later it just vibrated. I thought it made sense because first training data is not perfect, second there should be various good routes for vehicles to run on the road. So it is hard to judge whether model was getting overfitting or not by only loss in validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove the model was trained well, I can just test model by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py \"Training\" part).\n",

    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road on the basic map and driving on the right side on the advanced map. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used a combination of center lane driving (both forward & reverse), recovering from the left and right sides of the road (including curves).\n",
